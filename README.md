# BoatNavHomeApp
 Landing/start page for boat nav tablet, as PWA
 
 PWA means automatic "caching" of components I write. But what I want is automatic caching of external components too.
 
 Initial cheat: expose both native (out in the world) and offline (local) links for all resources (tide tables, Coast Pilot links etc.). Upcoming if I ever get to it, generic storage interface for offline docs like these with an update link.
